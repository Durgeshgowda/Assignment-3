                          The First Generation (1942-1955)
                          The first generation computers used the concept of ‘stored program’ and were
                          characterized by vacuum tubes. A vacuum tube is a delicate glass device that can
                          control and amplify electronic signals. The first generation computers were made using
                          Processor Communication Program + Data channel Storage (Memory) 8 thousands of vacuum
                          tubes and were the fastest calculating devices of their time. These computers were
                          very large in size, consumed lot of electricity and generated lot of heat.
                          UNIVAC 1 was the first electronic computer of this generation and was used for
                          business applications.<br><br>

                          The Second Generation (1955–1964)
                          The second generation computers were characterized by transistors. A transistor is a
                          solid state semiconductor device that revolutionized the electronic industry. Transistors
                          were smaller, highly reliable, consumed less electricity and generated less heat. Also
                          magnetic core memories were developed during this generation. These are tiny ferrite
                          rings that can be magnetized in either clockwise or anticlockwise direction so as to
                          represent binary 1 or binary 0. Magnetic cores were used as primary memories. Later
                          magnetic disks also came into existence and were used as secondary storage devices.
                          All these new developments – transistors, magnetic core memory and magnetic disk
                          storage devices made the computers more powerful and reliable. This further led to the
                          existence of operating systems. Programming languages like FORTRAN, COBOL, Algol
                          etc. also developed. Commercial applications of the computer increased and now the
                          computers were used in business and industries for applications like payroll, employee
                          9 management, inventory control etc. IBM 1401 and IBM 1620 were popular computers of
                          this generation.

                        <p>
                          The Third Generation (1964-1975)
                          In 1964, the Integrated Circuits or ICs or chips revolutionized the electronic industry
                          and started the third generation of computers. An IC is a small silicon chip or wafer
                          made up of extremely purified silicon crystals. It has numerous transistors, capacitors,
                          resistors and other elements of an electronic circuit. A small scale integration (SSI) chip
                          used to have about 10 transistors on a single chip and a medium scale integration (MSI)
                          chip had about 100 transistors per chip. The size of memories also increased. Various
                          mainframe computers and minicomputers were developed during this generation. Even
                          operating systems with multitasking and multiprogramming features (you will learn
                          about these terms in the next chapter) were developed. Since ICs made the computers
                          highly reliable, relatively inexpensive and faster, computers these days were found in
                          areas of education, small businesses and offices along with industrial and business
                          applications. IBM 360 was a very popular third generation computer.<br><br>

                          The Fourth Generation (1975 onwards)
                          In this generation Large Scale Integration (LSI) and Very Large scale integration (VLSI)
                          technology was used by which up to 300,000 transistors were used on a single chip.
                          Thus integration of complete CPU on a single chip was achieved in 1971 and was
                          named microprocessor which marked the fourth generation of computers. The
                          computers based on microprocessor technology had faster accessing and processing
                          speeds. In addition to this the increased memory capacity further made the computers
                          more powerful and also more efficient operating systems were developed for these
                          computers. New concepts of microprogramming, application software, databases,
                          virtual memory etc were developed and used.
                          The computers that we use today belong to this generation. These portable computers
                          can be carried from one place to another owing to their compact size. They are much
                          more accurate. Even memory sizes have become phenomenal. Commercial production
                          of these computers is easier and they are the least expensive, compared to the earlier
                          generation computers.
                          Also computer networks starting coming up during this generation. It is today one of
                          the most popular means to interact and communicate with people.

                          Fifth Generation Computers
                          Fifth Generation computers are still under development. This generation is based on the
                          concept of artificial intelligence. In simple terms the computers of this generation are
                          supposed to behave like humans. The principles of parallel processing (many
                          processors are grouped together) and superconductivity are being used to develop
                          devices that respond to human languages and will have the ability to apply previously
                          gained knowledge to execute a task. They will let them make decisions of their own to
                          execute a task. Some applications like voice recognition, visual recognition are a step in
                          this very direction.
